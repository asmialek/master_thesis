\subsection{Architecture}
    \ac{tool} is divided into two parts: 1) Parts Library and 2) Modular Simulation. The Parts Library contains Simulink subsystems, which can be connected to form simulations of various complexity and for multiple scenarios.\todo{library screenshot} The other is a Modular Simulation, which can be set up with either MATLAB command line scripts or graphical user interface.
