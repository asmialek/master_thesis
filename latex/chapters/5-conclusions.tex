        It was a mistake to try to build one simulation for both fast maneuvers and long term mission planning, as it is difficult to set up all simulation parts to work with varying time-step.

        While a set of sensors is modelled to be ready to use as a part of \ac{scars} Toolbox, there are no sensor fusion nor filtering algorithms included. The results are presented with perfect sensors.

        Currently the mission designer module is a very simple solution, leaving up to the user to create signals which would turn the control systems on and off, and create reference signals.
