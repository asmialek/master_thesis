\section*{Acknowledgement}
I would like to give my thanks to Dr. Martin Hromčík, my supervisor from Department of Control Engineering, FEL CTU. Without his guidance this work would be impossible and I especially appreciate all the help in the times of the coronavirus pandemic.\\[0.07cm]

I would also like to thank my girlfriend, Dominika, and my family. The former for her infinite patience and excellent proofreading, and the latter for support and understanding that aerospace student can sometimes walk with his head in the clouds.\\[0.07cm]

Finally, I would like to thank the students I have met during my studies at WUT, LTU and CTU. The motivation which comes from seeing as they develop themselves and pursue excellence is invaluable. Especially M.Sc., Eng. Maksymilian Sienkiewicz, as an exemplar of genuine specialist.
