\section*{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Aims:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item To provide a toolbox/rapid prototyping software
        \item For use for smaller projects, like CubeSat teams, without access to commercial tools
        \item For use for first Feasibility Study, or testing and comparison of different acutators
        \item For learning purposes (i.e. analogue to FCS course) 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Add database of example/know actuators/sensors
    \item Parameters of the block (for example: power consumption)
    \item Add methods of analisys of the control systems, ie. bode, pole plots 
    \item Methods for optimization
    \item Already existing tools:
    \begin{itemize}
            \item MATLAB CubeSat Simulation Library
            \item PrincetonSATELLITE Spacecraft Control Toolbox
            \item PROPAT Toolbox
            \item GAST Toolbox
          \end{itemize}
    \item What would differ SCARS from these tools:
    \begin{itemize}
            \item Ease of use
            \item Limited to only certain cases
            \item Open source
            \item Good documentation
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
